# ETL
The project involves the use of SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services), SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio), and SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services) to perform a comprehensive data integration, management, and analysis process.
SSIS, as mentioned earlier, is utilized for data integration, where it enables the extraction, transformation, and loading of data into a database. SSMS is employed to create the necessary database structure, including tables and relationships.
